# Lastify

## Description

This is a port of the Spotify.fm Greasemonkey script to a Safari extension. The script injects Spotify links into Last.fm pages so you don't have to copy/paste artist, album or track names. [The original script](http://www.spotify.com/fi/blog/archives/2008/12/18/spotify-scrobbles/) was written by one of the Spotify developers.

Since recent versions of Safari don't support the SIMBL plugin that enables the use of Greasmonkey scripts, I decide to bundle the script in an extension.

## Status

So far I have only made a few adjustments that were necessary to get the script running. The extension is fully functional as it is, but could use some refinements.
